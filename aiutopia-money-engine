# Aiutopia Money Engine — Reference & How-To

**Repo:** https://github.com/aiutopia1/aiutopia-money-engine

---

## Overview

Aiutopia Money Engine is an indestructible, modular backend system for profit, risk, and scenario simulation using both Bayesian and quantum algorithms.
Built for business, government, and advanced AI research—engineered for real-world money making, saving, and causal discovery.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/aiutopia1/aiutopia-money-engine.git
    cd aiutopia-money-engine
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

## API Endpoints

- **POST `/money_model`**
    - Predicts profit, risk, and causal “why” for any action/amount.
- **POST `/quantum_money`**
    - Runs 1,000+ Monte Carlo scenario sims with causal edge.

---

## Features

- Modular, pluggable “engines” for future upgrades
- Causal inference and quantum scenario modeling
- Contrarian/defensive algorithms (finds what others miss)
- Transparent outputs (risk, confidence bands, and explanations)
- Ready for custom data, dashboard UI, or scale-up

---

## Recent Updates

- July 2025: Repo launched with all engines and docs
- Next: Adding dashboard UI, live data feeds, and GNN/portfolio features

---

## To-Do / Roadmap

- Build frontend dashboard for live results
- Integrate with real-world APIs/data feeds
- Expand engine to portfolio and credit risk modeling
- Add AI-powered feedback/learning loop
